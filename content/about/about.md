Hey there! This is **Ahmed Imtiaz Ferdous**. Welcome to my personal website.

It's been a while since I completed my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering. Currently, I am looking forward to research opportunities. My interests are somewhat balanced by theory and practice. I have always been fascinated by how abstract mathematics can control the physical reality. I studied mechanical engineering theories while trying to learn coding by myself and involving myself in hands-on experience on robotics. Eventually, I came to know about my propensity for Robotics, Control Theory and Mathematical Modeling, and I would love to contribute in the field if possible. 

In my free time, I love listening to music, reading books, or watching TV series. Though I would like to identify myself to be more of a "Bedroom guitarist", I did, surprisingly, perform in some live shows. Jokes apart, I would like to create original music compositions someday, though I would still prefer to be mostly a learner in music, not a professional.

In this website, I mainly post original writings that are sometimes technical and tailored towards specific readers, or sometimes my opinions that I find to be insightful.
