Hey there! This is **Ahmed Imtiaz Ferdous**. Welcome to my personal website.

It's been a while since I graduated as a Mechanical Engineer. Currently, I am looking forward to research opportunities. My research interests are primarily focused on Robotics and Control Theory. I have always been passionate about how abstract mathematics can control the physical reality. I have been studying mechanical engineering while trying to learn coding by myself and involving myself to hands-on experience on robotics, which made me more resolute on my pursuit.  

In my free time, I love listening to music, reading books, and watching TV series. I started learning guitar as a stress-killer activity in my teens and eventually performed live in many occassions. Though I play guitar as an amateur hobbyist, I would love to contribute in music compositions, which I dream to do some day.

In this website, I mainly post original writings that are sometimes technical and tailored towards specific readers, or sometimes, just random thoughts or ideas for fun.
