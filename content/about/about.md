Welcome to my personal website!

I am **Ahmed Imtiaz Ferdous**, a recent graduate with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology. I am currently seeking research opportunities where I can contribute to the fields of Robotics, Control Theory, and Mathematical Modeling. My passion lies in the intersection of theory and practice—I am fascinated by how abstract mathematical concepts can be applied to control real-world systems.

During my undergraduate years, I balanced my coursework with hands-on robotics projects, which sparked my deep interest in the field. I am eager to continue exploring how control systems and automation can shape the future of technology.

Outside of academics, I enjoy music, reading, and watching TV series. While I consider myself more of a “bedroom guitarist,” I’ve performed in live shows and aspire to create original compositions someday. Music, however, remains a personal passion rather than a professional pursuit.

On this website, I share a mix of technical articles and personal reflections. Feel free to explore my work and thoughts!
