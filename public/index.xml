      <description>&lt;p&gt;The gimbal rig setup for a three degrees of freedom (3 DOF) system represents a cornerstone in the field of rotational mechanics and control systems. This configuration, often visualized through the classic example of a gyroscope, allows for precise manipulation and measurement of an object&amp;rsquo;s orientation in three-dimensional space. By employing a series of nested gimbals—each capable of independent rotation around orthogonal axes—this setup provides a robust framework for exploring complex rotational dynamics. In our testbench, a drone is securely mounted within the innermost ring of the gimbal rig, with each joint equipped with sensors to measure angular displacement. This configuration not only facilitates the study of the drone&amp;rsquo;s orientation and stability but also enhances our understanding of control strategies in dynamic environments. The adaptability and precision of the 3 DOF gimbal system make it a powerful tool for experimental research and development in modern engineering and technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Aruco Tag detection using OpenCV and Python</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aruco Tag, also known as AR Tag, is widely used in navigation and tracking purposes in robotics field. With machine learning and modern image processing techniques, it is not difficult to detect and identify AR tags. However, in this post, I will try to use the most basic image processing tools of OpenCV for the approach to that problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-statement&#34;&gt;Problem Statement&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are four photos of random settings where there are posters containing the AR Tags. Each of the posters are somewhat distorted due to perspective of the camera. For demonstration purposes, only the first setting will be shown in the latter sections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there! This is &lt;strong&gt;Ahmed Imtiaz Ferdous&lt;/strong&gt;. Welcome to my personal website.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I completed my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering. Currently, I am looking forward to research opportunities. My interests are somewhat balanced by theory and practice. I have always been fascinated by how abstract mathematics can control the physical reality. I studied mechanical engineering theories while trying to learn coding by myself and involving myself in hands-on experience on robotics. Eventually, I came to know about my propensity for Robotics, Control Theory and Mathematical Modeling, and I would love to contribute in the field if possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
