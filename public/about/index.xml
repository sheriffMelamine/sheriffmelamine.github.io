      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there! This is &lt;strong&gt;Ahmed Imtiaz Ferdous&lt;/strong&gt;. Welcome to my personal website.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I completed my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering. Currently, I am looking forward to research opportunities. My interests are somewhat balanced by theory and practice. I have always been fascinated by how abstract mathematics can control the physical reality. I studied mechanical engineering theories while trying to learn coding by myself and involving myself in hands-on experience on robotics. Eventually, I came to know about my propensity for Robotics, Control Theory and Mathematical Modeling, and I would love to contribute in the field if possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
