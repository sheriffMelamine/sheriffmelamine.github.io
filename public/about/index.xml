      <description>Hey there! This is Ahmed Imtiaz Ferdous. Welcome to my personal website.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I graduated as a Mechanical Engineer. Currently, I am looking forward to research opportunities. My research interests are primarily focused on Robotics and Control Theory. I have always been passionate about how abstract mathematics can control the physical reality. I have been studying mechanical engineering while trying to learn coding by myself and involving myself in hands-on experience on robotics, which made me more resolute on my pursuit.</description>
